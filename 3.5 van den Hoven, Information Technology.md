# 1. Why personal data will always be in demand
Four types of reasons for explain why personal data is and will always be in demand:
- government agencies may want to have access to data about citizens to serve them better
- commercial parties want to be able to serve their customers or clients better
- personal data like credit risks or commercial past performance can be used to assess risks in a transaction, but to link customers with transactions this requires (re)identification.
  - collection of personal data is also deployed in employer - employee relations by use of surveillance and logging
- government agencies may want to gather data in the interest of public good
  - central problem of public goods is managing access to them, more specifically exluding access to those who do not contribute (free riders)
  - by gathering personal data these free riders can be identified

Reasons why people object to gathering personal data:
- people might not want to have to learn about another person's private life **(the right to be left alone, decisional or constitutional privacy)**
- people might not want another person to learn about their private life **(informational privacy or tort privacy)**

Ethics of data protection is concerned with the latter.

# 2. Personal data
Properties of personal data:
- multiple-realizable: may be stored in different places or different media
- may be generated by a variety of techniques, from RFID tags to searching databases to cameras
- data does not have a meaning separate from the context in which it is used

When is someone processing personal data?
Consider the following:
- C1: 'X is in restaurant A at time t1'
- C2: 'Y is in restaurant A at time t1'.

In isolation 'Y is in the Restaurant at time t1' does not
tell you anything about X, but when combined with C1, it can be deduced that X and Y were meeting in A.

People present guises to others in daily life, but they can also disguise themselves, like tax evaders for example.
They use different names x and y to register different bank accounts so the authorities can't deduce that x = y, resulting in tax fraud.
This results in the need to recognize and (re)identify people unambiguously, to arrest, detect tax fraud, etc.

By relating little facts like 'the owner of a blue Ford' or 'the owner of a bank account 1234567' to the same person, knowledge about this person can rapidly be expanded.
This is also important because, 'for a loss of privacy to occur, the information must be 'about' the individual'.
Therefore it is also essential to define what counts as personal data (and is worthy of protection).

According to EU:
'"personal data" shall mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject"); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly (id nr, appearance, ...)'

Distinction between _referential_ and _attributive_ use of descriptions (such as that guy with a blue ford):
- **attributive**: that random guy yesterday at the mall who owned a blue Ford 
- **referentially** (particular person): that specific guy who owned a blue Ford

Both these uses expose information on people and represent _identity-relevant information_.
The EU data-protection laws only protect from referential use of data and leaves attributive use unprotected, leading to little moral constraints for use of data.
The object of protection should not be defined as referential data but as _identity-relevant information_.

# 3. Moral reasons for protecting personal data
Four types of moral reasons for protecting data, which form grounds for principles like EU data-protection act and Organisation for Economic Cooperation principles:
## Information-based harm
Information is very useful for criminals, some harms could not have been inflicted without certain information. Refer to this as 'information-based' harm.
- identity theft and fraud, plundering bank accounts etc
- victims can be tracked down via internet
- preventing information-based harm provides a strong moral reason to limit access to personal data
  - nazi regime as a well known argument against a central database of people, note that the nazi's didn't violate privacy, but only used insufficiently protected data
 - by selectively releasing (dis)information you can destroy someone's career
 - in a western country, being classified as a Muslim could also be considered information-based harm (reduced chance for jobs etc)

## Informational inequality
## Informational injustice
## Moral autonomy and moral identification
