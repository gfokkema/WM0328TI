1. Introduction
Whole genome sequencing has become increasingly feasible the last years, especially since the Human Genone Project had completed its goals in 2003:
- 1990 first posited
- 2003 first whole genome, cost 3 billion
- 2014 cost only 5000, 2-3 days
- cost 1000, 1 day is soon a reality

Several opportunities, but also raises ethical questions:
- targeted medicines according to genome profile "right drug at the right time"
- biomedical research
- direct-to-consumer services (eg disease risk tests)
- forensics
- privacy issues, framework for CS:
- - what security / privacy is needed in each handling step?
- - - "The privacy issues associated with genomic data are complex, particularly because such 
        data has a wide range of uses and provides information on more than just the individual 
        from which the data was derived."
- - - there is a great fear of the unknown, we learn new things about the genome
- - what threat models are realized at each step?
- - open computational research problems?

- Some treat genomic data no differently than traditional health data, though many believe that it should be handled with care

2. Special features of genomic data
One likely scenario for use is a company which uses genomic data to explore family trees.
Suppose it is later discovered that your genomic profile indicates you are vulnerable to dementia.
The company has this data as well.
Sharing genomic data therefore might result in unexpected or undesired consequences, eg drug companies targeting her

DNA based data is of long-lived value, contrary to most other tests, and distinguished by:
- kinship
- health
- traceable
- unique
- mystique
- value
Therefore DNA data is 'exceptional' and warrants particular care.
DNA is a long-term value so it can be held and used over extended periods of time, while temperature / blood pressure is short-term

Can change your outlook, if you know too much, eg if you know you might get dementia, will you act/do things different. Will your family? 

3. Uses of Genomic data
This section reviews several major applications:

3.1. Health Care
Mutations in an individual's genomic sequence can influence one's well being, eg diseases
Some of these diseases can be mananged, if known, some aren't
Some individuals choose to learn their genetic status so they can plan their future, or contribute to medical research
Can be applied in prenatal scanning 

3.2. Research
Often to support the health care domain
Because of the decrease in cost of genome sequencing means data can be collected, stored and analyzes for hundreds of thousands of people

3.3. Direct-to-Consumer Services
Genome sequencing has become feasible for individuals and has led to applications such as:
- genetic compatibility tests with potential partners
- personal 'genome passport'
- track kinship

3.4. Legal and Forensic
DNA data can be used for tracking:
- parentage suits
- track down suspected criminals
- - use kinship data to determine likely identity of perpetrator
- - unclear whether law enforcement may retain and/or use in the future
- - - at the moment in the USA, DNA can be retained of suspects, even if the suspect is not prosecuted
- - - The individual relinquishes rights of ownership of their dna, and it can be sequenced
- - currently 'abandoned' DNA may be used without consent

4. Relevance of genome privacy
Genomic data has numerous distinguishing features and applications.
If leaked, this information can be misused
- genetic discrimination
- - Insurance
- - Employment
- - Education
- blackmail
- what may happen in the future, what will then be revealed
- privacy sensitivity of genomic data, and the potential treats will most likely increase over time.
- Helicopter pilot, who got rejected because her scan showed mutations for cancer, military is allowed to discriminate 
- Henrietta Lack, died 1951, who's cervical cancer cells helped with important developments in medical treatments. Her genomes were sequenced and published, without asking consent from her living family. They complained, due to the information this would give about her family, but by then it was too late, the data had already been downloaded and parts of it had been published.
- There is no consensus about the scope of control that individuals and their families ought to have over the downstream of their cells.
- Thousands of people have placed their genomic data on the web without seeking permission of their relatives.
- Threats emerging form genomic data are only possible via the leakage of such data, eg reckless clinician, breached it system, the sequencing facility, malware from your phone if stored there, even by the individuals themselves by uploading their data with their name attached.
- Since 2007, in the USA, prohibits certain types of discrimination in access to health insurance and employment
- There are, in fact, hundreds of legal systems in the world, ranging in scope from federal to state/province and municipality level, each of which can adopt different definitions, rights, and responsibilities for an individualâ€™s privacy.
- challenging to enforce, as uses of data cannot always be detected
- the potential importance of genomic data for mankind is tremendous, privacy can be considered a obstacle
- for advances in medicine, large numbers of  participants are needed
- trust is then needed, and an insurance of privacy
- need techniques that will guarantee the security and privacy of genomic data, without significantly degrading the efficiency of the use of genomic data in research

(CHAPTER 5 COULD BE SKIPPED IN MY OPINION)
5. Genomics / Genetics Expert Opinion
5.1. Objective - Asked a group of biomentical researchers about privacy and security issues
5.2. Survey Design
5.3. Data Collection Methodology
5.4. Potential Biases
5.5. Findings
5.6. Discussion

6. Known Privacy Risks
6.1. Re-identification threats
-Re-identification -> recover the identities of the individuals involved
-Pseudo-anonymized Data -> recover eye/hair/skin colours, which will lead to the donor's identification from genotypes
-Attacks on Machine-Learning Models -> can also reveal information about the people whose data was used to train the models
6.2. Phenotype Inference
-Aggregate Genomic Data
-Correlation of Genomic Data
-Kin Privacy Breach     -> if both parents are genotyped, then most of the variants for their offspring can be inferred
                        -> Such reconstruction attacks can be carried out using
                                (i) (partial) genomic data of a subset of family members, and 
                                (ii) publicly known genomic background information.
6.3. Other threats
- Anonymous Paternity Breach -> DNA testing has made tracing anonymous sperm donors easy; thus, theoretically, sperm donors can no longer be anonymous
- Legal and Forensic -> Can be abused, staging crimes
