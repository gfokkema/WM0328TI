# 3.3 Granny and the robots: ethical issues in robot care for the elderly

## Assistive robots and elder care

There are a lot of developments of robots for supporting the elderly.
Robots can be used to improve life. Reasons include:

* reduce dependency on caretakers that dont respect the elder (e.g.
  refusing help with bathroom visits reduces dignity <- relates to value of human welfare)
* Empower and increase independence (autonomous wheelchair, exoskeleton)

Another way of using robots is to see(use) them as merely a tool, such as the exoskeleton instead
of a replacement.
However, this comes with ethical issues. How much control should an elderly be allowed with this
technology? E.g. should a robot accept a command from the person that would result in injuring this person.
Other problems arise because the state of psychical and mental condition will not likely be stable. Elderly
may become suddenly confused and may ask for the above command.
Another issue is that of accountability. If a robot malfunctions, resulting in an injury, who is to blame?

Besides these "small" issues, there are two "big" issues that related to the use of robots.

### Reducing the amount of human contact

If robots are extensively used for elder care, then it might reduce social interaction
because the human cleaner is no longer needed, thus the elder don't have contact with
them.

This reasoning also applies to dull and dirty tasks with children where those tasks often
provide opportunity for social bonding.

This problem arises because this ethical problem is not explicitly addressed by human rights.
Only article 5 (no torture, no inhuman or no degrading treatment ) and article 9
(no arrest,detention or exile without reason) could provide a base for why social interaction is needed.
Also, other research on elderly suggests that social interactions affects welfare positively.
Elderly with social interactions shown less risk for dementia and Alzheimer than elderly without.
Also found it that humans with social interactions recover faster from distress, which means that social
reduces stress levels.

### Objectification

Elderly may feel that robots that replaces nurses that there are treated like an object.
It could be that those robots make elderly feel less free than when they were dependent on
other humans. Because such a robot may treat a person like a lump a meat, only concerned
with the task given (i.e. moving person) without reference that it helps a sentient being.

## Robots that monitor and supervise the elderly

Potential benefits for using robots here includes:

* monitoring elderly for unexpected changes and then alert caretakers
* Assist eldery with cognitive disorders, giving them advice(like: go to bed)
* Surveillance, checking if elderly not suddenly go outside without cloths in winter

Downsides include:

* Reduction of human interaction and companionship (fewer visits of elderly because they could be monitored from elsewhere,
  virtual visits cant give a person a hug for example)
* Risk of reducing privacy, due to excessive monitoring (problems arise if a person is against monitoring in the bathroom but
  forget,due to mental disorder, that their robot teddybear is also monitoring everything)
Another problem with this is, how long should this data be stored? And who can access this information freely(family,friends,doctors) ?
* Restriction on activities that elderly can do (recognizing potential danger and prevent the elderly of making this decision, a slippery
  slope argument is that it could lead to authoritarian robots).
Another example is that the robot would not allow the elderly to leave the house(i.e. health reasons). But this means
that the elderly are imprisonment in their home without trial.
* What actions are legal for a robot to take (can it injure elderly with effect that it prevents danger? (e.g. restrain elderly crossing
  a dangerous road))

An example where monitoring is deployed with some success is a home where security measurements are taken (e.g. turn off the cooker automatically)
but the system can always be overridden by the person to allow for freedom. Also, familiy was used to record voices that the system could used to
encourage to person to go to bed.

## Robots as companions for the elderly

These robots are mostly modeled after friendly animals and give elderly some companionship.
This effect is measured to have an impact on welfare, just like a real animal does. It even showed
that both robot and real animals can be used simultaneously to increase the welfare(reduces stress).
Examples include: Robotic seal, dog, cat, expressive doll. These robots include things like fur, express
emotions and can learn responses from the user.

Other positive examples are that it can encourage social interaction. The robot can give something to talk
about with other people or give a reason to visit (e.g. to play with the robot)

However, caution is needed for the following reasons:
* Some studies compared groups where not chosen correctly (group with only a robot for companionship, another without companionship from anything)
Not clear if relative improvement if the same if it is compared to human companionship. Also, some situations indicated that companionship of a robot
is only temporary, elderly lost interest in the robot (e.g. robot was only used for a month before elderly stop using it)

Ethical issues:
* Reduction of human companionship (dont worry about Granny, she has a robot to talk to)
Issue because robots are far from being a real companion, because:
    ** Deception (emotions are of the robot are fake,same type of response, but elderly will still bond with the robot and eventually think that the robot can be much more than it is actually capable of)
    ** Infantilization (robots are made to response or treat the elderly as children)

Other studies have shown that the interaction with the robot differs between elderly that are interested in the technology behind the robot and those
that interact with the robot "as is". More study is needed to figure out the potential and differences between elderly on interacting with the robots.
