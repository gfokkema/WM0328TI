# Value Sensitive Design

*Value Sensitive Design* is an approach to the design of technology that accounts for human
values in a pricipated and comprehensive manner throughout the design process.

*Value* is what people consider important in life.

##Phases:
There are three phases to be distinguished:

- Conceptual investigations
    * who are the stakeholders in design at hand
    * how are the stakeholders affected by design at hand
    * what values are implicated
    * how should we engage in trade-offs between competing values in design, implementation and use of information systems
    * should moral values (right to privacy etc.)> nonmoral values (aesthetic appearance)
- Empirical investigations
    * how do the stakeholders apprehend individual values in the interactive context
    * how do they prioritize competing values in interactive context
    * how do they prioritize competing values is design trade-offs
    * are there any differences between espoused practice (what people said) & actual practice (what people do) 
- Technical investigations
    * how do technological properties & underlying mechanisms support or hinder
    values?
    

*Values Sensitive Design*

- Seeks to be proactive to influence design of technology early in and througout design process
- enlarges arena in which values arise. Nor only workplace but also education, home, commerve, online, public life
- contriubtes unique methodology that employs conceptual, empirical, technological investigations
- enlarges scope of values beyond corporation, participation, democracy to include values with moral import
- distinguishes between usability and values with ethical import
- identifies & takes seriously direct & indirect stakholders
- is interactional theory
- builds from physchological proposition that certain values are universally held, although how such values pay out in particular culture/point in time can vary


VSD Suggestions:

- start with a value or context of use, start with central value and work from there
- identify direct and indirect stakeholders
    * one group divided in subgroups?
    * one person may be member of more than one group
    * one stakeholder may be divided in direct & indirect stakeholders
- identify benefits/harms for stakeholders
- map benefits/harms to corresponding values - conduct investigation of key values
- identify potential value conflicts
- integrate value considerations into organizatinal structure
- human values are often implicated in system design
- heuristics for interviewing stakeholders
